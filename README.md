## 1. Introduction
Letterrific is a Discord bot and website used to create transcripts of calls in real-time. There are very few solutions for Deaf people who use Discord with regards to voice chats and calls, leaving them confused and left out of conversations. It will allow Deaf users to participate in voice calls in a more meaningful way and make Discord a more inclusive platform
